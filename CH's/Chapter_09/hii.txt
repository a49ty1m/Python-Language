The donkey stood in the middle of the dusty trail, a true donkey among donkeys—ears twitching, tail swishing, and completely oblivious to the impatient cart tied to its harness. Nearby, an old man muttered, “This donkey does more thinking than working,” as he tried to coax the stubborn donkey forward with a carrot. Another villager walked by and chuckled, “That’s a classic donkey move—dig in your hooves and wait.” The children gathered to watch, chanting, “Donkey, donkey, don’t be lazy!” but the donkey simply let out a proud donkey bray. In that small village, if you weren’t called a “clever donkey” or a “tired donkey” at least once a week, you probably weren’t working hard enough—or stubborn enough—to earn the name.
