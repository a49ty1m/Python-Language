The ****** stood in the middle of the dusty trail, a true ****** among ******s—ears twitching, tail swishing, and completely oblivious to the impatient cart tied to its harness. Nearby, an old man muttered, “This ****** does more thinking than working,” as he tried to coax the stubborn ****** forward with a carrot. Another *******r walked by and chuckled, “That’s a classic ****** move—dig in your hooves and wait.” The children gathered to watch, chanting, “Donkey, ******, don’t be ****!” but the ****** simply let out a proud ****** bray. In that small *******, if you weren’t called a “clever ******” or a “tired ******” at least once a week, you probably weren’t working hard enough—or stubborn enough—to earn the name.
